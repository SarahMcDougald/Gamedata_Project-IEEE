## What is this?

IGN, short for Imagine Games Network, is an online video game rating company that reviews and rates games. It has been criticized by some video game fans for "bad behaviour" such as giving unfair rating scores, potential bias towards certain game companies or franchises, and publishing uninformed reviews. (For example, [this IGN reviewer of _Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=eQj1AcIAGcM#t=263) was unaware of the fact that the game he was reviewing was an HD remaster of an old game). While interested in both video games and video game reviews, I have not dug too far into the IGN debate myself, so I decided to see whether numbers might illuminate a clearer picture of IGN's ratings and their influences.

The goal of this project was to determine: Can IGN scores be predicted, given some superficial variables about a video game? If so, to what degree? While one cannot definitively conclude from the statistical learning (i.e. machine learning) methods applied here whether or not IGN is a biased source, using such predictive tools it is possible to investigate what variables might influence IGN ratings.

## Background

This is a small machine learning project I presented at the IEEE NU (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers at Northwestern 
University) annual Project Showcase competition in 2018. The project was completed in a couple weeks, done on my own time. The analysis 
was built off of data scraping that I began a few months prior for an in-class project. I may continue
