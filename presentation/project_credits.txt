This is a list of credit and thanks I would like to give to sources that aided
me in this project.

Data and made it publicly available. Reddit link:

WIKIPEDIA DATA

I scraped the Wikipedia data from pages that were compiled by volunteers at
Wikipedia.com. The following are a list of pages I scraped from, each with a
list of the names of the data tables scraped.

I frequently used the famous statistical learning primer, the Introduction to
Statistical Learning with Applications in R (ISLR). I used the ___third___
edition. This is an incredible book, and is invaluable for anyone trying to 
use statistical learning or machine learning methods.

Thanks also to the STAT 301-1 class that taught me the fundamentals of data
science in R. In that class, we had an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) final
project that was creative, independently-directed (I did my project on my own)
and we could choose any data source to study. I used the same raw data in this
analysis as I used from that project-- and I also used *some* of the data
processing code. HOWEVER, the models, extended discussion, and all other
variables scraped from Wikipedia besides the Engine variable were done outside
of class (in addition to this in-class project being largely self-directed in
the first place).
